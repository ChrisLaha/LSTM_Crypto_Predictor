# LSTM_Crypto_Predictor
Use deep learning recurrent neural networks to model bitcoin closing prices. One model will use the FNG indicators to predict the closing price while the second model will use a window of closing prices to predict the nth closing price.
- Prepare data for training and testing.
- Utilize closing prices and the Crypto Fear and Greed Index(FNG) to determine which is a better signal.
- Build and train LSTM RNNS
- Evaluate performance of each model
